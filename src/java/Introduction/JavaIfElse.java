/*
Using "if-else" you can perform decision making in Java. See the flowchart below (taken from wikipedia):

This problem will test your knowledge on "if-else" statements.

Given an integer  as input, check the following:

If  is odd, print "Weird".
If  is even and, in between the range of 2 and 5(inclusive), print "Not Weird".
If  is even and, in between the range of 6 and 20(inclusive), print "Weird".
If  is even and , print "Not Weird".
We given you partially completed code in the editor, complete it to solve the problem.
